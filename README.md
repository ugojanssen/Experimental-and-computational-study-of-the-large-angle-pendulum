# Experimental-and-computational-study-of-the-large-angle-pendulum

During my physics class in the IB, I was starting to get taught about SHM. I learned how to calculate the period of a pendulum and realized that the formula they gave had a small angle approximation. This led me to wonder what would happen if the angles were greater than the small angle approximation.

The experiment aimed to investigate how the period ùëá of a swinging pendulum varies with large amplitudes. The study focused on measuring the period of a pendulum as it swings from various initial angles ranging from 15¬∞ to 165¬∞. The research involved constructing a pendulum setup, taking precise measurements of its oscillation periods, and comparing the results with theoretical predictions. The research also included a computer simulation of the pendulum motion, allowing for a deeper understanding of the deviations from the small angle approximation and validating the experimental results. The findings indicated that the period of the pendulum increased significantly with larger angles, challenging the limitations of the small angle approximation.

The code provided in the PDF simulates the motion of a pendulum at large angles. It uses numerical methods to solve the differential equations governing the motion of the pendulum. The key steps of the code involve defining the pendulum parameters, initializing variables for angle and angular velocity, and implementing a time-stepping algorithm that iteratively updates the angle and velocity based on the forces acting on the pendulum. The results from the simulation are then compared with experimental data to assess the accuracy of the model. The code is designed to allow for varying initial angles, providing a comprehensive analysis of the pendulum's behavior beyond the small angle approximation.
